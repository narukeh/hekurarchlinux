This = "[larbs.xyz](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/larbs)" + "a lot of modifications" on a Live system (.iso).

This is just an archiso, that has [illirice](https://github.com/narukeh/ilirice) (a [voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) fork) __only__ for the live system. So u can use this as any official archlinux iso, to instal vanilla archlinux, __but__ while beeing on a graphical enviroment (dwm/i3).

I use this, as no other live system feeds my needs in which i can:
  1. Install ArchLinux
  2. System Rescue
  3. __Feel comfortable while doing all that__

----

<small>As of right now, it is just my installed system on a .iso, i will be adding pkgs which are common on a live system.</small>
